A sequence of <i>n &gt; 0</i> integers is called a <i>jolly jumper</i>
if the absolute values of the difference between successive elements
take on all the values 1 through <i>n-1</i>.  For instance,
<p>
</p><pre>1 4 2 3
</pre>
is a jolly jumper, because the absolutes differences are 3, 2, and 1
respectively.  The definition implies that any sequence of a single
integer is a jolly jumper.  You are to write a program to determine
whether or not each of a number of sequences is a jolly jumper.
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>
Each line of input contains an integer <i>n</i> &lt;= 3000 followed by <i>n</i> integers
representing the sequence. 
</p><h3>Output</h3>

 For each line of input, generate a line
of output saying "Jolly" or "Not jolly".
<h3>Sample Input</h3>
<pre>4 1 4 2 3
5 1 4 2 -1 6
</pre>
<h3>Sample Output</h3>
<pre>Jolly
Not jolly
</pre>
